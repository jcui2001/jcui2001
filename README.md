I’m interested in building full-stack applications involving AI, Machine Learning, data manipulation, data mining, and visualization, especially to create new innovations in business and technology. 
I’m currently learning Machine Learning applications, data quality assurance, and storage reliability with large-scale information retrieval and analysis using Python, SQL, NoSQL, and other database software.
I have completed or am actively working on projects and products where I apply skills and concepts involving NLP, ETL, backend server and frontend development.

Skills:
- Python
- Java
- SQL
- Web. dev stack (HTML/CSS/Javascript)
- React.js
- Node.js
- Django
- Various deployment hosts (Docker, Jenkins, GitLab)
